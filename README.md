# Achievement

### 1. Because the project ended very successfully, We have earned their trust and concluded additional contracts with them.

### 2. I learned how to lead a project while working on this project.

I was able to understand what's the important jobs for Project Leader apart from his speciality. As a leader, regardless of what your speciality is, you will end up spending a lot of time talking to clients and project members. This includes reviewing the client's requirement, communicate with team members and other departments to find out if there is an issue in the process. For me, every time our project manager added new functionality of the software to the proposal, I had to think through whether this is feasible and could be done by the deadline. If there's a technical issue with the requirement, I had to explain the issue in non-programming terms and suggest an alternative. I didn't realise how massive responsibility a leader has before the beginning of the project. Although all of the responsibilities I was required to deal with was unfamiliar and overwhelming at the beginning, my productivity could increase little by little every time I solved a variety of issues. Also, the more we understood each other's workflow, the easier it became to collaborate. I highly believe I learned and grew significantly from the experience.

# Note

Due to the company policy, I can only open the client-side code.
