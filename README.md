# Achievement

<!--
## This project motivated me to build a reactjs open-source library

[Link To My Crontab library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reactjs-crontab)

I realised building a crontab (scheduling jobs) is quite tedious and difficult to test. This motivated me to create a node open-source package, which allows you to easily build a crontab functionality. I created this package entirely on my own. There is an average of approximately 300 weekly downloads.

# Note

Due to the company policy, I am unable to open the source code.
